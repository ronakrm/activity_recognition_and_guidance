CS 766 Computer Vision Final Project

# PIPELINE
video segments -> dense trajectories (observed features) -> HMM (action being performed) -> Petri Net (guidance/should this action be performed etc etc)

## Dense Trajectories
Need OpenCV which needs FFPMEG. Talked with Eugene, was having significant trouble with Mac. We should figure out how we want to develop/on what platform/etc.
